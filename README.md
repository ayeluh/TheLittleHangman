Greetings!🤩 You're about to embark on a thrilling word-guessing adventure—The Little Hangman! 
This classic game tests both your vocabulary skills and your wits as you try to uncover the hidden word before running out of chances. But beware—this game comes with high stakes!

You'll need to guess the secret word one letter at a time. If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in its proper place. 
However, if you guess wrong, the stakes get higher. Every incorrect guess costs you one life, and you only have 8 lives. 
Each time you choose a wrong letter, you lose a life, moving closer to your fate. The goal is to guess the entire word before your lives run out.

⚠️🗣 Instructions 🗣⚠️

📌Start the game: A hidden word will be chosen randomly, and its length will be displayed as blank spaces (e.g., _ _ _ _ for a 4-letter word).

📌Guess a letter: You can suggest any letter that you think might be in the word.
If your guess is correct, the letter will appear in its proper position in the word.
If your guess is incorrect, you lose one of your 8 lives.

📌Crushed lives: Each wrong letter choice brings you closer to defeat. Once all 8 lives are lost, the game is over.

📌Victory: Successfully guess all the letters of the word before losing your lives to win the game!

Good luck!🍀 Choose your letters wisely, and let’s see if you can outsmart the little hangman.🤩
